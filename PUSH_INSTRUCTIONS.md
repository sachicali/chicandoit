# Git Push Instructions

Your repository has 3 commits ready to push to origin/main:

1. `67757bc` - Rebrand app to Vici with new logo, violet color scheme, animations, and redesigned landing page
2. `e163c33` - Add Claude Code sub-agents for specialized optimization
3. `40e7455` - Update .gitignore and remove build artifacts from tracking

## Issue
The push is failing due to:
1. Large commit size (removing 12,402 files)
2. Network connectivity/timeout issues

## Solutions to Try

### Option 1: Increase timeout and buffer
```bash
git config http.postBuffer 524288000
git config http.lowSpeedLimit 0
git config http.lowSpeedTime 999999
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Use SSH instead of HTTPS
```bash
# Add SSH key to GitHub first, then:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:sachicali/chicandoit.git
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Push commits individually
```bash
# Push first commit
git push origin 67757bc:main

# Then push second commit
git push origin e163c33:main

# Finally push the large commit
git push origin 40e7455:main
```

### Option 4: Use GitHub Desktop
GitHub Desktop handles large pushes better than command line in some cases.

### Option 5: Force push (use with caution)
```bash
git push -f origin main
```

## Current Status
- All features are committed locally
- Repository is clean (only bun.lock is untracked)
- Waiting for successful push to GitHub

## Notes
- The commit `40e7455` removes 12,402 build artifact files
- This is causing the push to timeout
- All your work is safe in local commits
