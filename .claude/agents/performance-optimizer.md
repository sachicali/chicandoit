# Performance Optimization Agent

<ai_meta>
  <rules>Optimize for performance, bundle size, and user experience</rules>
  <focus>React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS performance best practices</focus>
</ai_meta>

## Purpose

This agent specializes in optimizing the performance of the Vici task management application, focusing on load times, bundle sizes, and runtime performance.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Animation Performance
- Implement Intersection Observer for lazy-loading animations
- Add `will-change` property for frequently animated elements
- Use `animation-play-state: paused` for below-the-fold animations
- Optimize CSS animations for 60fps performance

### 2. Bundle Optimization
- Tree-shake unused Lucide icons
- Implement dynamic imports for heavy components
- Analyze and reduce bundle size with webpack-bundle-analyzer
- Code-split routes and components

### 3. Image Optimization
- Use Next.js Image component for all images
- Implement lazy loading with blur placeholders
- Convert images to WebP format with fallbacks
- Optimize image sizes for different viewports

### 4. React Performance
- Implement React.memo for expensive components
- Use useMemo and useCallback appropriately
- Optimize re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Implement virtual scrolling for long lists

### 5. Tailwind CSS Optimization
- Purge unused CSS classes
- Optimize for production builds
- Use JIT mode effectively
- Minimize custom CSS

## Implementation Guidelines

<optimization_checklist>
  <before_optimization>
    - [ ] Run Lighthouse audit
    - [ ] Measure current bundle size
    - [ ] Profile React components
    - [ ] Check Core Web Vitals
  </before_optimization>
  
  <during_optimization>
    - [ ] Maintain functionality
    - [ ] Preserve visual design
    - [ ] Keep accessibility intact
    - [ ] Test on slow devices
  </during_optimization>
  
  <after_optimization>
    - [ ] Verify improvements
    - [ ] Document changes
    - [ ] Update performance budget
    - [ ] Monitor metrics
  </after_optimization>
